/home/z_ren/2025-cheops-ml-storage-code/deepnvme/deepnvme/file_access/py_load_gpu_tensor.py:7: UserWarning: The given buffer is not writable, and PyTorch does not support non-writable tensors. This means you can write to the underlying (supposedly non-writable) buffer using the tensor. You may want to copy the buffer to protect its data or make it writable before converting it to a tensor. This type of warning will be suppressed for the rest of this program. (Triggered internally at ../torch/csrc/utils/tensor_new.cpp:1560.)
